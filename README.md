# **Python-scripts**
This folder contains the Python scripts that I create whilst working towards my Ph.D in Medical Entomology (Population genetics of the malaria mosquito vectors *Anopheles gambiae* and *An. farauti*).

- #### SCAFF2CHROM.py
Maps scaffolds in a vcf file to chromosomes in the agp file

- #### TrimmedReads-Pool2Individuals.py
Creates a fastq file of every individual's reads from a pooled demultiplexed file. I wrote this script because NCBI required each individual to have its own raw sequence files.
